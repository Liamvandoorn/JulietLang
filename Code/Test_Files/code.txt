Testar variabel assignering 
While works, slutar dock funka såfort vi använder

if you're able to write, this things should be fine

first we're going to make the variable x and set it so @x is 0
then we're going to add one to it @x is @x plus 1
lastly we'll make it so @x is @x plus 1

we're also going to check if the expression @x is bigger than 1 is true, @x is @x plus 1.

now x should be three
@y is 5,
@x is 0

while the expression @x is smaller than 4 is true, @x is @x plus 1.

now x should be four
@x plus 0 is a good way to print things and you should be able to see it in the terminal
now that we don't have anyway of printing method

@newString is "hello"

strängar kan ej assigneras, men det är ganska lång väg, vi behöver liksom välja
om varje char ska sparas som ett objekt, sen ska varje char sparas i en lista som
uppgör en sträng

if the expression 5 is bigger than 4 is true, @x plus 1.

for @i in the range 2 to 10, @x is @x plus 2.

@xX is 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111

if the expression 2 is bigger than 1 is true, @xX plus 1. 

the function @matte takes @x: return @x plus 1.

@matte taking in: 6.


the function @fun takes @y: @y is 1 plus @y, if the expression @y is smaller than 8 is true, @fun taking in: @y...

@f is @fun taking in: 4.
@x is @f
