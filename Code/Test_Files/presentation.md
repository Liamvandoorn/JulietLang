This file will be used on the presentation of the project so it must be perfect, Sadly one can not use punctuation in this language yet so the text may look a bit odd, If it helps you may think of the comma as punctuation,

A classic thing to do when using a new programming language is to print out hello world in the terminal, we may do this by calling @print taking in: "Hello world".

Juliet can do math using variables, first we're going to make the variable x and set it so @x is 0 then we're going to add one to it so @x is @x plus 1 and lastly we'll make it so @x is @x plus 1, now we @print taking in: @x. Here we can use punctiation because it is part of the function call syntax,

if the expression @x is bigger than 1 is true, @x is @x plus 1. Now x should be three, @x is 0 and then while the expression @x is smaller than 4 is true, @x is @x plus 1. Now x should be four so we can print it by calling @print taking in: @x.

Let's look at functions, the function @fun takes @y: @y is 1 plus @y, if the expression @y is smaller than 8 is true, @fun taking in: @y..:return @y. This is a recursive function, @f is @fun taking in: 4. @print taking in: @f.


```
 @testing_variable is "hello world"
 @print taking in: @testing_variable.
```
