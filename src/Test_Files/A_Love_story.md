# Chapter 1
*A quick example story*

We're going to write a short story about Romeo And Juliet
There once was a prince, Romeo, Romeo is alive and thereofore @romeo is "Alive" and therefore
@juliets_heart is "whole"


This is a modern love story so Romeo gets hit by a red lamborgini,
the cars @speed is 49 km and if the expression @speed is bigger than 50 is true, then @romeo is "Dead" and @juliets_heart is "broken".


however, as shakespear wrote a comedy tradgedy, we write a happier tale and if you're familiar with programming, you might know that

```
@print taking in: @juliets_heart. and thereofore we'll print the ending @print taking in: "they lived a happy ever after".
```
