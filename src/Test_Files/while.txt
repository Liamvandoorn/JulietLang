we're going to showcase a while loop now, thirst we'll create the variable x @x is 0

let's try to loop through it now, while the expression @x is smaller than 4 is true, @x is @x plus 1.

now x should be four
@x plus 0 is a good way to print things and you should be able to see it in the terminal
now that we don't have anyway of printing method

@variable_2 is 46

@print taking in: @variable_2.
